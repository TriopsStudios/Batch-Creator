I created this little program to try WinApi with c++ for the first time.
It just creates a batch code for the products of the company I work for.
The program thakes the name of the product and translates it to a pre-assigned number. Then adds the last number of the year, and the day of the year
depending on the month and day of the month provided. 

If month/day or product is wrong, then the program will show an error message.

You can try it with the product COW-WASH-LYO which code is 8100.
